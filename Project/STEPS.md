Step 1 — Environment Setup Create a virtual environment, install all the libraries from requirements .txt and create the .env file with your OpenAI and Tavily API keys.

Step 2 — Create tools py 
We will build 2 custom tools using the @tool decorator. First the web_search tool which talks to the Tavily API and fetches live search results from the internet. Second the scrape_url tool which takes a URL, visits that page and extracts clean readable text from it using BeautifulSoup.

Step 3 — Create agents.py 
This is the heart of the project. We will build 4 things here. 
First the Search Agent using create_agent() from lanchain.agents- just pass teh mdoel and tools and returns a ready to use agent graph powered by langgraph internally (no agent executor or hub prompts needed ). 
Second the Reader Agent using the same pattern but with the scrape_url tool. 
Third the Writer Chain using the modern LCEL pipe syntax — prompt|llm|StrOutputParser() which takes all the research and writes a full report. 
Fourth the Critic Chain again using LCEL pipe which reads the report and gives a score and feedback.

Step 4 — Create pipeline.py
This is the supervisor. We will write one function called run_research_pipeline that calls all 4 agents and chains in the correct order and passes results between them using a shared state dictionary. The agents use message-based input/output — we send {"messages" : [ ( "user", "..." ) ] } and read the response from result [ "messages "] [—1].content. At the end of each step it will print the output in the terminal so students can see exactly what each agent is doing.
